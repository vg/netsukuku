La Rete, Tao della conoscenza
che unisce il molteplice nell'uno,
deve rinascere libera,
ed avvolgere in un caldo abbraccio
la dolce madre Gaia.

Questo e' il risveglio, 
il risveglio di tutti noi che finora 
siamo vissuti immersi nella nebbia,
braccati dalla chimera di un putrefatto Wired,
e' il nostro risveglio.

Unitevi e non abbiate timore,
le porte sono aperte,
la Rete ci attende.

We've begun the ntkd implementation of the second version of the
Netsukuku theory, which has been improved and simplified since 
the last news [1].

This time we're working with Python, because:

	1) we're prioritising the release of a stable, functional
	   prototype.

	2) since it's easier to maintain a completely modular architecture
	   of the Ntk daemon, the coordination between the developers is
	   enhanced.

	3) the Ntk daemon is an application that requires very low
	   computational and memory resources: it is network bound.
	   As example, consider the original Bittorrent implementation,
	   written in Python.

	4) we're going to use our own stripped version of Python, in
	   this way it will be possible to use Netsukuku in embedded devices.
	   See for example: http://www.areasx.com/index.php?D=1&id=8173

	5) the C language will be used to implement low level code.

We hope that as soon as possible a first stable release of Netsukuku will
will be available.

----------------------------

The implementation of the QSPN v2 has started [1].

The core code is being completely rewritten. The code in general is becoming
completely modular [2] with a clean and reusable API.
The code documentation is also growing: every part of the sources is being
heavily commented.

Since we're busy with the new code, we can't actively follow the bugs of the
current releases, however you're invited to report them [3].

The Netsukuku daemon will come back operative with the 1.0.0b release, which
will include all the new changes.
We hope that when the new code will be ready, more developers will join the
project, since it will be possible to work, in parallel, to many part of
Netsukuku.

PS: Right now, dyne.org is down, so the wiki and the ntk mailing list are down
    too.
