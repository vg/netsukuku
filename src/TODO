		[HIGH PRIORITY] 

- tracer.c:920

- Implement all the NTK_RFC: http://lab.dyne.org/Netsukuku_RFC

- Internet Gateway Search
	- infinite loop between gateways if they use each other as gw
	- duplicate nexthop entries in the multipath route
	- multigw

- Test the BIG ENDIAN code with a BIG ENDIAN arch. Qemu?

		[MEDIUM PRIORITY] 

- Restricted mode with 172.16.0.0 and 192.168.0.0.
	- what happens when two different restricted net meet?
		- they must not rehook!

- do not delete a tunnel-gw if there is still traffic on it

- Equalize multipath routes

- Bandwidth weight for each entry of the qspn (not just rtt and latency):
	- what to use to get the bandwidth of a network interface?

- Gnodes contiguity
	- gnode re-hook
		- When we have two different gnodes A and C, and
		  then B hooks to A, nothing happens, since C, doesn't
		  receive any qspn_pkt
		- test: two (g)nodes with the same IP
			- currently only in particular situations the rehook
			  isn't possible: A - A,  A - B - A.
	
	- Challenge
		- RSA between rnodes: the nodes which are already hooked ask
		  for the public key to the node which is hooking.
		- Creation of the problem.
		- Resolution of the problem.
		- Diffusion of the reply.
		- Reject of challenge for X time after a first challenge has
		  been completed.
		- Do just one challenge at the same time, reject/delay all the
		  other which came later.
		- If the challenge was rejected/delayed wait the right amount
		  of time and retry.
		- Ban of gnodes which lost the challenge ?
		- Challenge between two gnode not contiguous, which have the
		  same gid.

- Port the kernel route code for *BSD: take a look at rt_ioctl.c and
  rt_socket.c of quagga.
  
- API for the maps sync with the netsukuku_d daemon.

- Write the documentation for the code that can be used by other
  programs. (By the way it is already commented.)


		[LOW PRIORITY]
		
- Interactive shell/console

- option to disable the modification of the routing table

- Change with something else the eliminable fatal() calls in netsukuku_hook()

- Ipv6 support: use ff05::23 for multicast. qspn_gnode_count isn't IPv6
  compatible!

- Test request.c

- Port the code to uclibc. The best would be NetsukukuD flashed into an AP.
