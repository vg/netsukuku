# If this option is set to 1, NetsukukuD will be started in restricted mode to
# allow the compatibility with Internet. In the restricted mode, are chosen 
# only IPs of the largest private subnet, i.e. 10.x.x.x.

#
# * * If you have an Internet connection please fill this options. * *
#
# We are assuming that you are running in restricted mode since you want to
# be both in Netsukuku and Internet. So, if you have an internet connection
# set `internet_connection' to 1.
#
# Set the `internet_gateway' option to the IP of the gateway you use to reach 
# the Internet and specify the network interface too, for example:
# "internet_gateway = 192.168.1.1:eth0". This option is necessary only if you
# don't have the default route set when you run NetsukukuD (i.e. you haven't
# connected yet), otherwise, leave it commented.
#
# You have also to set your upload and download bandwidth in 
# `internet_upload_rate' and `internet_download_rate'. It is expressed in Kb/s,
# so if you have a line which maximum can do: 640 Kb/s in dwload and 30 Kb/s in 
# upload, set them to 640 and 30.
#
# `internet_ping_hosts' is a list of Internet hosts which will be pinged to
# verify if the connection is alive, you can use the default hosts.
#
# Finally, If you want to share your Internet connection among other Netsukuku
# nodes, set `share_internet' to 1.
