- ANDNA
	- Core: use ntk/core/p2p.py to implement the basic services of ANDNA.
	  As an example, see coord.py. It is a P2P services based on p2p.py.
	  Keep in mind what is written in doc/main_doc/ntk_rfc/Ntk_p2p_over_ntk.pdf
	  
	  The ANDNA core is composed by two different P2P services: 
	  	1) the service that stores the IPs
		2) the service of the counter nodes, that stores the number of hostnames registered by a node.

		- You need to use OpenSSL to implement the cryptographic part of ANDNA
		  (see 3.4 Cryptographic ANDNA  of andna.pdf)
		  You can easily port the src/crypto.[ch] C wrapper because it
		  uses standard calls to OpenSSL.

		- Try to copy the old C implementation (src/andn*.[ch])
		  You can leave almost unchanged some function:
		     andna.c: andna_hash(), andna_hash_by_family(), andna_resolvconf_modify()
		  Moreover you can read some function to know the detail of
		  the ANDNA protocol, even by just reading the comments, for
		  example see andna.c: andna_hook(), andna_update_hnames()

	- Implement the resolution cache, see (3.10 Distributed cache for
	  hostname resolution) and see src/andna_cache.[ch]
	  In python you should be able to implement it in less than two days ;)
	  Try to optimize it! A cache should be fast and small.

	- Adjust the C implementation of ANDNS and make it work with the pyntk
	  version of ANDNA. ANDNS is the DNS server which listen to DNS
	  queries and calls the  client part of ANDNA to resolve them.
	  Note: you shouldn't recode ANDNS in python. It is already good in C,
	  you have just to interface pyntk and ANDNS.
	  Make ntk-resolve work too.

	- Implement the Scattered Name Service Disgregation (see andna.pdf)

	- Revise and implement the Local ANDNA RFC ( see http://lab.dyne.org/Ntk_local_ANDNA )

	- Write a test suite for everything ;)
